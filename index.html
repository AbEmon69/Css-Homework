                <p> <span>P</span>lanting trees is really important for our environment and our future. Trees give us oxygen, food, and homes for animals. But some people are cutting down trees too much, which is bad for the land and causes problems like floods and erosion. We need to plant more trees along rivers and coasts to stop erosion and make the air cleaner.</p>
                <p>Also, planting trees in high places can help stop global warming. We should plant trees in more places and make sure everyone knows how important it is. The government should help by encouraging people to plant trees and taking care of them. Trees are super important for us, so we all need to work together to plant more and keep them safe.</p>
